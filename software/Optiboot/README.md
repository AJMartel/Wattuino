Although it has evolved considerably, Optiboot builds on the original work of Jason P. Kyle (stk500boot.c), Arduino group (bootloader), Spiff (1K bootloader), AVR-Libc group and Ladyada (Adaboot).

Optiboot is the work of Peter Knight (aka Cathedrow). Despite some misattributions, it is not sponsored or supported by any organisation or company including Tinker London, Tinker.it! and Arduino.
Maintenance of Optiboot was taken over by Bill Westfield (aka WestfW) in 2011.
