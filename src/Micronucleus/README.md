# Micronucleus

[Micronucleus](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus) is a bootloader designed for Atmel AVR ATtiny microcontrollers with a minimal usb interface, cross platform libusb-based program upload tool, and a strong emphasis on bootloader compactness. To the authors knowledge this is, by far, the smallest USB bootloader for AVR ATtiny.

This project is released under the GPLv2 license.
Code uploaded via the bootloader is not subject to any license issues.
